        "1- What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        " Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and open-source programming language that is easy to read, write, and learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is popular because:\n",
        "\n",
        "It has a simple syntax, making it beginner-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "It offers a large collection of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn that are very useful for data analytics, machine learning, and visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "It has a strong community support, so learners and professionals can easily find help and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is versatile, used not only in data analytics but also in web development, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "The Python interpreter is a program that executes code line by line. It translates human-readable Python code into machine instructions. This makes debugging easier and allows immediate feedback when running Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "Keywords are special reserved words in Python that have predefined meanings and purposes. They cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "Examples: if, else, while, for, True, False, None, def, class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "No. Keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved for special functions in Python.\n",
        "Example: Writing if = 5 will give an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "Mutability means the ability of an object to be changed after it is created. If the contents of an object can be modified, it is mutable; if not, it is immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are mutable because their elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples are immutable because once created, their values cannot be modified. This makes tuples faster and safer for fixed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "== checks if the values of two objects are the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "is checks if two variables refer to the same memory location (object identity).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "print(a == b)  # True (same values)\n",
        "print(a is b)  # False (different objects in memory)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "and → returns True if both conditions are True.\n",
        "\n",
        "or → returns True if at least one condition is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "not → reverses the result (True becomes False, False becomes True).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "x = \"100\"\n",
        "y = int(x)  # type casting string to integer\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit casting (Type Conversion): Done automatically by Python. Example: 3 + 2.5 = 5.5 (integer converted to float).\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit casting (Type Casting): Done manually using functions like int(), float(), str().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "Conditional statements allow decision-making in code. They let a program execute certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are True.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "if age >= 18:\n",
        "    print(\"Eligible to vote\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"Not eligible\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "The elif (else if) statement checks multiple conditions one by one. As soon as one condition is True, the corresponding block executes, and the rest are skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "marks = 75\n",
        "if marks >= 90:\n",
        "    print(\"Grade A\")\n",
        "elif marks >= 60:\n",
        "    print(\"Grade B\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"Grade C\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "for loop → used when the number of iterations is known.\n",
        "\n",
        "while loop → used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "When we don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run.\n",
        "Example: Keep asking the user to enter a password until they enter the correct one.\n",
        "\n",
        "password = \"\"\n",
        "while password != \"1234\":\n",
        "    password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n",
        "print(\"Access granted\")"
